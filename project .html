    <h2>FRIED RICE</h2>
    <h4>History about Fried rice</h4>
    <p>
      Fried rice is a classic Chinese dish that often appears
      on restaurant menus. This delightful, delicious jumble of rice and mix-ins
      also boasts a long, illustrious history that cannot be ignored. Fried rice
      was originally invented in China, and today, it is a delicious dish in its
      own right
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the years, fried rice has evolved to suit local palates all over the
      world. Various renditions of fried rice that draw from cultures and
      cuisines of countries such as Thailand, Japan, and even the U.S. have
      originated as well. Fried rice is deceptively simple and almost impossibly
      quick to throw together, as evident by this 30-minute fried rice
      recipe. While it can be easy to prepare, fried rice can turn out quite
      soggy if precautions aren't taken to reduce moisture prior to cooking. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, fried rice is often consumed as a meal in its own right.
      However, Eating China reports that fried rice was originally invented as a
      way of using up leftover rice. In China, where fresh, fluffy, white rice
      is preferred, fried rice is a matter of convenience and economical meal
      planning. It was a way for low-income families to consume rice and
      vegetables that may be past their prime and to save money in the process. 
      There is no better way to use up small amounts of meat, vegetables, and
      leftover rice: Simply fry them all together in a wok, add soy sauce, and
      you've got fried rice! These days, creative recipes even call for adding
      other items to fried rice. Ingredients such as herbs, nuts, seeds, or even
      cheese are all unexpected foods to add to fried rice that make
      this Chinese dish even tastier.
